# VulkanRenderer

This is my study project, starting from September 2023, for a whole semester. The goal is to utilize the Vulkan graphics API to create a renderer that creates realistic and stunning real-time renders of cars and other objects with clear-coat pbr materials, utilizing raytraced shadows and reflections, but rasterization will be used for the rest of the rendering.

## Features
- Raytraced shadows
- Raytraced reflections
- Physically-based rendering with clear-coat materials
- Post-processing (Tonemap, gamma correction, exposure)
- Mipmapping
- HDR environment maps

## Maybe Features
- Bloom
- Dithering
- Lens flare
- Bigger scenes
- Data streaming
- LODding
